# Thoughts on Linked List: 
# Access an element by numeric position (as with an array index)
# Pop the "first" element (head gets removed, second element becomes head)
# Push an element onto the beginning of the list (first element becomes second element)
# Remove the (first occurance | all occurances) of an element by data content
# Remove an element by position
# Insert an element at an arbitrary position
# Add an element after a known node
# Find whether a data element is or is not in the list
# Find the distance between two nodes
